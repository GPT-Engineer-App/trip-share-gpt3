SharECar TriP: Driver & Rider App Home Page (GPT-3 Engineering Prompt)
SharECar TriP aims to be a user-friendly and efficient car sharing & taxi booking app, combining both driver and rider functionalities within a single platform. This prompt outlines the key elements for the SharECar TriP home page, designed for use with GPT-3 engineering.

Target Users:

Drivers seeking to share their car and earn extra income.
Riders looking for affordable and convenient transportation.
Home Page Design:

Layout: The home page should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing. It should be optimized for both smartphone and tablet displays.

This prominent element should allow users to:
Enter their pick-up location (address or current location) as a rider.
Enter their destination (address) as a rider.
Optionally, specify a drop-off location as a driver offering a ride.
The search bar should automatically suggest locations based on user input.
Toggle Switch (Top Right):
This switch allows users to seamlessly toggle between "Rider" and "Driver" mode.
The home page layout and displayed information should dynamically change based on the selected mode.
Rider Mode (Default View):

Ride Options: Display a list of available rides in the user's vicinity. This list should include:
Pick-up location and estimated arrival time.

Estimated fare for the trip.
Filter Options (Optional): Allow riders to filter available rides based on:
Car type (Sedan, SUV, etc.)

Utilize GPT-3 to create dynamic content for the promotional banner, suggesting relevant offers or safety tips based on user data and current events.
GPT-3 can be integrated for natural language processing within the search bar, improving location suggestions and understanding user input.
Overall, this prompt provides a comprehensive framework for the SharECar TriP home page, leveraging GPT-3's capabilities to enhance user experience and create a dynamic and informative interface for both riders and drivers.
